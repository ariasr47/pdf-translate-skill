"""Stage 2 of pdf-translate: extract translatable segments from the ORIGINAL PDF.

Reads text with exact geometry and writes two files:

  segments.json     every placeable segment: page, bbox, baseline origin,
                    font size, bold/italic, raw text, parsed marker / gap /
                    body_dx / core /
                    dot-leader info. retypeset.py consumes this.
  to_translate.json unique normalized "core" strings that need translation,
                    with occurrence counts. Author translations for ALL of
                    these (pass-through items are pre-filtered out).
  widget_text.json  the translatable strings that live in annotation
                    dictionaries and never reach a content stream: /TU
                    tooltips, choice /Opt display labels, text-field /V and
                    /DV defaults. Author the "target" of each, then pass the
                    file to strip_text.py --widget-text. Empty object when
                    the PDF has none. A value that is DATA — a 2D-barcode
                    payload such as USCIS's PDF417BarCode1
                    ("I-864|08/24/26|1"), an ID, a date stamp — gets its
                    source string back as the target: identity-mapped,
                    never translated (null refuses the build; a translation
                    corrupts what the form submits).

segments.json also carries a "document" block: the source /Lang, /Title and
the outline (bookmark) titles. The title and the outline entries are added
to to_translate.json as cores, because the window caption, the bookmarks
pane and every screen reader read them.

Page text is read from an annotation-free display list. get_text() includes
widget appearance streams, so a text field's default value and a combo
box's current choice would otherwise arrive as page text: the author
translates them, retypeset draws the translation on the page, and the
widget keeps drawing the source value on top of it.

Segmentation rules (why they matter):
- A visual line is split at horizontal gaps > GAP pt between spans: one line
  often holds several independent cells (CITY: STATE: ZIP:) or a label and a
  dot-leader run separated by a checkbox gap. Each piece is placed on its own.
- The line's direction vector is recorded per segment ("dir"). Rotated
  lines (side labels, stamps) keep their angle at re-typeset time; a
  rotated line is never gap-split, because the x distance between its
  spans is not a horizontal gap.
- List markers (a., (1), 12.) are peeled off and kept verbatim, together
  with the whitespace that followed them ("gap") and the measured distance
  from the origin to the body's first glyph ("body_dx", from the
  characters the source drew). retypeset draws the marker in Helvetica
  whatever the source font, so Helvetica's own advance is right only for
  a Helvetica-metric source; the measured offset is right for any.
- Trailing dot leaders + optional currency symbol are peeled off; retypeset
  refills dots anchored to the right so they never invade mid-line gaps.
- Segments whose core is empty or purely numbers/symbols are pass-through
  (re-inserted verbatim) and excluded from to_translate.json.
- Segments containing a run of >= 6 spaces INSIDE one span are flagged in
  "warnings": they usually hide a mid-line gap (checkboxes between phrases)
  that gap-splitting cannot see. Handle each with an "overrides" entry in
  translations.json rather than a plain translation.
- Write/find/say candidates (quoted strings, form/document names, URLs,
  emails) are flagged for confirmation — they often must stay verbatim.
- Image regions big enough to carry words (banners, seals, stamps,
  screenshots) are listed as "image-region" review items. Nothing here
  translates pixels; a person looks at each one.
- Consecutive same-column lines that look like a wrapped paragraph are
  flagged as merge *candidates* (kind "merge-candidate"). Never
  auto-merged; declare each merge
  explicitly in translations.json.
- Segments that share a right edge while their left edges differ, and
  sit within one em of a rule, a field or the next segment, are flagged
  "right-aligned": a longer translation anchored at the left grows past
  the edge it was tucked against. Justified text shares a right edge too
  and is a merge, never a column. The author lists those cores in
  "right"; nothing is realigned automatically.
- Three or more stacked cores sharing a skinny column (same left edge,
  bbox under 90 pt wide) are flagged "narrow-column": a pay-stub box or
  label stack, where translating each line-break on its own turns the
  box to crumbs. Warn only — never merged, and no verify gate.
- A page whose text is invisible (an OCR layer over a scanned image, or
  text hidden under an image) is refused: the words the reader sees are
  pixels, and retypeset would print the translation over them. The
  script exits non-zero and names the pages (kind: invisible-text).

--pages takes 1-based, inclusive page numbers ("1-10", "3", "11-20,25-")
so a long manual can be worked in slices: extract a range, author it, and
combine the mappings with `pipeline.py merge-mappings` before the single
retypeset over the whole document.
