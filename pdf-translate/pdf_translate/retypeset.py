"""Stage 4 of pdf-translate: re-typeset translated text onto the stripped PDF.

Consumes segments.json (from extract_segments.py) + translations.json
(authored by you — format documented in references/translations-format.md)
and writes the translated PDF. All layout mechanics live here so every
document gets the same behavior:

- single-line segments -> TextWriter at the ORIGINAL baseline origin
- a list marker is re-emitted in Helvetica followed by the whitespace the
  source printed after it (segment "gap"; one space when a segments.json
  predates the key), and the body starts at the measured offset the
  source's own characters had (segment "body_dx"), because Helvetica's
  advance for the marker is only right for a Helvetica-metric source;
  without that key the body starts at Helvetica's width of marker + gap
- shrink-to-fit bounded by the nearest same-row obstacle (next segment or
  widget rect) so text never overlaps fields or neighboring cells
- dot leaders refilled anchored to the RIGHT at most the original run width
  (keeps leaders out of mid-line checkbox gaps), including on labels drawn
  by the Story engine (shaped scripts) or right-to-left
- '‖' in a translation splits a bold lead-in from a regular remainder
- declared merges rendered as re-flowed paragraphs via insert_htmlbox
  with auto-shrink (scale_low=0); a merge whose html is null is an
  accepted proposal nobody wrote yet, and FAILs like a null translation
- centered strings re-centered on the original bbox midpoint; strings in
  "right" re-anchored on the original bbox RIGHT edge, so a longer
  translation grows leftward instead of past the rule it sat against
- four font roles (regular, bold, italic, bold-italic) chosen from the
  source span's flags; a single-line target may carry inline <b>/<i>
  (or <strong>/<em>) and is then placed through the Story engine
- the compliance notice, if the job needs one, placed from "notices" into
  the box the author chose — the only text here that is not the
  translation of an existing string, and it goes through the same glyph
  check, canonical layer, scale report and placement gate as every run
- pass-through segments re-inserted verbatim in Helvetica
- every non-passthrough segment lacking a translation is reported; the run
  FAILS (exit 1) if any exist — missing text must never ship silently
- any run scaled below 0.7× FAILS unless its core (or merge first line) is
  in allow_scale — tiny type must not ship as a note
- document metadata is retargeted: /Lang (and dc:language in XMP) from
  translations.json's "lang", /Title and every outline title from the
  mapping (both are cores), and the orphaned /StructTreeRoot is removed
  with /MarkInfo /Marked false, because the tags describe text that no
  longer exists
- every character of every placed run is checked against the exact font
  object that will draw it; a character the font lacks FAILS, because
  MuPDF substitutes a fallback face mid-string (or draws a box) and
  reports nothing
- RTL targets (Hebrew/Arabic) are written with right_to_left and wrapped in
  /ActualText so the logical string is in the text layer; layout stays LTR
  unless translations.json sets mirror: true (opt-in x-flip of text +
  field/link rects; graphics stay)
- runs whose target script needs shaping (Arabic-family, Indic, Thai, Lao,
  Khmer, Myanmar, Tibetan) are placed with the Story engine
  (insert_htmlbox, HarfBuzz) on the original baseline, at the original
  size and colour, then wrapped in /ActualText; TextWriter would draw
  them letter by letter (isolated Arabic forms, broken conjuncts)
- rotated lines (side labels, stamps) keep their angle: the run is written
  horizontally and morphed about its own origin by the segment's recorded
  direction, so origin, bbox and line direction match the source run. The
  width budget runs along that direction. Dot leaders, centering and the
  RTL mirror stay horizontal-only ideas and are skipped on a rotated run;
  a rotated run whose target also needs SHAPING is refused rather than
  drawn flat

    Silent. Returns a RetypesetResult. Raises on refusal — `GlyphError` when
    the face cannot draw a character, `MappingError` for an unauthored core or
    a merge that does not match, `PlacementError` for a run that will not fit
    or a notice that cannot be placed. Every one carries `.refusals`: each
    refused item, by kind, with the core untruncated.

    `progress(done, total)` is called once per unit of work. The total is
    **pages plus merge jobs**, because this runs two loops: a per-page pass and
    then a per-merge pass. A counter of pages alone reaches 100% and keeps
    going.

    `cancel()` is checked at the top of every unit in both loops. When it
    returns true the run stops and returns `RetypesetResult(cancelled=True,
    output=None)`. There is exactly one save, at the very end, so a cancelled
    run cannot leave a partial file — the absence is by construction, not by
    cleanup.

    `scale_report` is where the scaled-runs report is written. `None` means
    write nothing and return the runs in the result; the default is today's
    behaviour, a fixed name beside `out` — which two concurrent jobs writing
    to one directory would race for, so a service passes its own path.

    `resource_root` is the directory authored HTML resolves its resources
    against. It defaults to the **mapping's** directory, not the process's
    working directory: a service that runs from anywhere else was silently
    getting a substituted face.
