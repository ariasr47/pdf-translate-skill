"""What a stage returns, and what it raises.

E3's consumer contract asks for every stage to be callable from Python with a
schema-versioned result out and a typed exception on refusal — no printing, no
exiting, no dependence on the working directory.

The pattern is not new here. `verify`/`run_verify` and `qa_check`/`run_qa`
already split a loud printing function from a silent one returning a frozen
verdict. This module is the rest of that family, so the split is one shape
learned once rather than seven.

Why a split at all, rather than simply silencing the existing functions:
`tests/test_pipeline.py` holds 177 `redirect_stdout` blocks and 128 of them
wrap a library function **directly**. Silencing those functions would break
every one of those assertions and every caller written against today's shape.
The twin costs two entry points per stage; silencing costs the contract.

The exceptions carry `console_line` and `exit_code`. That is the whole
mechanism that keeps the eleven CLIs byte-identical while the library grows a
typed surface: the loud wrapper catches, logs the line it would have printed,
and returns the code it would have returned.
