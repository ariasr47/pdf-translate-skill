"""Gate 21, leak-cjk: when source and output share the spaceless CJK family,
characters that cannot belong to the target language are the leak.

retypeset refuses a segment the mapping omits, so the leak that reaches a
delivered document is an echo — the translator returns the source as the
target, and the mapping says target == source, as it does for a date or a
name. A verbatim rule cannot see that; a script tell can. Measured
(docs/BRIEF-cjk-leak-tell.md, dev/probes/cjk_leak_tell_probe.py, 2026-09-16):
zero tells on eleven own-language texts including corpus/ja_source.pdf,
3–56 on the other language's texts, 14 on an echoed segment in a real
ja → zh-Hans delivery.

The tells are encoding repertoires — cp932 (JIS X 0208 + Microsoft
extensions) for Japanese, GB 2312 for Simplified Chinese, Big5 for
Traditional Chinese — plus kana for either Chinese target. No data files.
NFKC first: a source PDF's ToUnicode drifts to compatibility ideographs
(U+F98E 年, U+F92C 郎) and an authored mapping carries them into the output.
Nothing here prints.
