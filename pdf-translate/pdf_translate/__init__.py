"""Importable stages for pdf-translate.

The skill's documented CLI paths remain ``scripts/*.py``. Those files are
thin wrappers around this package so ``python scripts/pipeline.py`` is
unchanged. A consumer imports from here:

    from pdf_translate import strip_text, extract_segments, retypeset
    from pdf_translate import prepare_font, field_fonts
    from pdf_translate import run_verify, run_qa
"""

__version__ = '66'

# The mapping formats this engine can READ, so a consumer can ask before it
# authors rather than after. `legacy` is translations.json as it has always
# been; `typography-1` adds the opt-in occurrence/style records described in
# references/typography.md, and is present because the supported matrix was
# verified end to end on real files, not because the format was written down.
#
# This describes implemented format support. It is not a claim that the skill
# is ready for public release (A01 and the other blockers stay open), nor that
# any given document will succeed: unsupported source constructs still refuse,
# and the CJK italic and bold-italic roles have no measured positive cases
# because no suitable real face was available to measure them with.
MAPPING_FORMATS = ('legacy', 'typography-1')

# Importing this package needs all three third-party packages, because the
# stage modules below import them at module level. Say so once, naming every
# one that is absent, instead of failing on whichever the first import
# happened to reach. Nothing is relaxed here: the same imports succeed or
# fail as before, only the message changes.

# A library configures no logging for its host: one NullHandler so a record
# emitted before the caller sets anything up does not print a
# "No handlers could be found" warning, and nothing else. No level is set on
# this logger or on the root; `pipeline.main` attaches a real handler for the
# CLI, and a consumer attaches its own.
