"""The one handler that reproduces this skill's console exactly.

Every stage logs; nothing prints. A CLI entry point wraps its work in
`console()` and the lines arrive on stdout byte for byte as `print` wrote them.
A consumer importing the library gets silence and a result object, and attaches
whatever handler its own service uses.

**Re-entrant, and that is not a nicety.** `pipeline.py` calls five library
functions directly — `strip_text` (in `cmd_init`), `retypeset`
(`cmd_rebuild`), `render_pages` (`cmd_render`), and `field_fonts` and
`compare` (`cmd_finish`). Once each of those is a loud wrapper that opens
`console()` itself, `pipeline.main()`'s handler and the wrapper's would both be
attached to the same logger and every line would print twice. Nested uses
share the outermost handler instead.

**CLI entry points only.** This mutates process-global logging state and is not
thread-safe. A service calls the silent `run_*` twins and attaches its own
handler; it never calls this. Silent calls avoid stdout interference but do
not make PyMuPDF thread-safe. Concurrent PDF jobs need separate processes and
job directories; see `references/consumer-guide.md`.
