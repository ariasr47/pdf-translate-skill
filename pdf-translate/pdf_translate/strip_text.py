"""Stage 1 of pdf-translate: prepare a PDF for text replacement.

Deletes ALL page text (BT..ET blocks) from content streams while leaving
vector graphics, images, and form-field widgets untouched, wraps surviving
content in q/Q (prevents graphics-state leakage into text you add later),
and removes the XFA layer if present (hybrid LiveCycle forms render the XFA
layer in Acrobat, hiding page edits).

Form XObjects are stripped recursively (an XObject inside an XObject, any
depth) and page /Resources are resolved through /Parent inheritance, because
letterheads and imposed pages hide text there.

Strip is also a gate. After saving, the stripped file is re-read with
annotation appearances excluded; if any page still has text the run FAILS,
lists page and text, and the stripped file is deleted. A stripped file that
still carries source text must never reach retypeset. Widget captions and
field values are appearance streams, not page text; they do not count.

Never use redaction annotations for text removal: they delete overlapping
form-field widgets.

Usage:
  python3 strip_text.py IN.pdf OUT.pdf [--hide-buttons name1,name2,...]
                                       [--captions captions.json]
                                       [--widget-text widget_text.json]
                                       [--keep-encryption]

--captions rewrites pushbutton /MK /CA strings in place (field count stays
exact). --hide-buttons sets the Hidden flag instead. Prefer captions when
the widget should remain as the UI chrome.

--widget-text rewrites the text that lives in the annotation dictionaries
and never reaches a content stream: /TU tooltips, choice /Opt display
strings and text-field /V /DV defaults. Export values are preserved (an
/Opt entry becomes [export, display]); a spec that would translate a
choice /V is refused, not ignored. extract_segments.py writes the
scaffold. Exit 2 on a mapping that is unauthored or wrong.

/Perms is always deleted and reported. /Perms /UR3 (Adobe Reader
extensions) and /Perms /DocMDP (certification) sign the bytes this script
rewrites, so both are invalid the moment text is stripped; leaving them is
what makes Acrobat announce "extended features are no longer available" or
"the document has been altered" over an otherwise correct file. A
certified source is flagged so the deliverable can say the certification
is gone. Signature fields themselves are left alone (field parity).

The output is unencrypted unless --keep-encryption, which re-applies the
source's permission bits with an EMPTY owner password — the original
cannot be recovered from the file, so those permissions are advisory. Say
so when you deliver.

Prints a JSON report to stdout: pages processed, XFA removed or not,
pushbuttons that have no /A action (dead if XFA was removed — decide
whether to hide them, rewrite captions, or leave them), Form XObjects that
contained text (also stripped, with nesting depth), rewritten widget text,
and leftover_text (empty on success). Exit 1 when leftover_text is not
empty.
