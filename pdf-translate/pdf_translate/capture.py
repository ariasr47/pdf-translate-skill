"""Self-contained evidence bundles for a below-the-floor scale refusal.

B1 (wrapping a translation onto a second line) cannot be planned because
nobody can measure how much it would recover: every attempt to obtain a
real failed job came back empty, because a refusal prints a message and
exits — nothing ever wrote the inputs anywhere
(``docs/reviews/2026-09-19-b1-recovery-probe.md``). This module is the fix:
when :mod:`pdf_translate.retypeset` is about to raise because a run scaled
below :data:`pdf_translate.retypeset.SCALE_MIN`, it hands the exception and
the job's paths to :func:`capture_refusal`, which writes everything a later
session would need to reproduce the refusal, unasked, to a directory the
caller names.

Three rules shape every function here:

1. **Opt-in, default off.** Copying a customer's source PDF to disk is a
   side effect nobody should get by surprise. Nothing in this module runs
   unless a caller names a directory, either through ``capture_dir=`` on
   :func:`pdf_translate.run_retypeset` or through the
   ``PDF_TRANSLATE_CAPTURE_DIR`` environment variable (see
   :func:`resolve_capture_dir`).
2. **Never change the build's outcome.** :func:`capture_refusal` catches
   everything — a full disk, a bad path, a permissions error, a bug in this
   module — and only logs it. The caller always re-raises the *original*
   exception, unmodified, whether or not the bundle was written.
3. **Record unknown as unknown.** A below-floor occurrence's permitted box
   is only ever taken from an existing authored source (a legacy merge's
   ``box``); when no such record exists, the bundle says so explicitly
   rather than inventing one — B1's design forbids inferring a box the
   caller never drew.
