"""Gate 20, han-forms: the face that drew a CJK page uses the forms its
language expects.

Han unification gives 直 骨 海 one code point each; a Japanese face and a
Simplified Chinese face draw them differently, and a reader sees the wrong
region at once. This skill never selects a face — the caller does — so the
delivered document is judged: every embedded face on a page that draws CJK
text is rendered off its own font program (the way gate 18 re-probes a
conjunct face) and compared pixel for pixel with the Noto reference of the
language's convention and with the other convention's, both instanced at
the embedded face's weight.

Measured (docs/BRIEF-han-forms-gate.md; PyMuPDF 1.28.2, the fetched Noto
Sans JP / SC variable faces): a face against its own reference at equal
weight reads 0.000 on every probe; against the other region 0.17–0.51;
weight alone (400 vs 100) reads 0.51–0.55, as large as region, which is why
references are instanced at the delivered weight. 東 is drawn the same in
both conventions: a face that differs from both references on 東 is not a
Noto face and is REVIEW, never matched to the nearer reference.

Nothing here reads the network or prints. The reference faces are files the
caller provides: tests/fonts/ in a checkout, a directory of its own in a
service (verify --reference-fonts DIR, run_verify(reference_fonts=DIR)).
