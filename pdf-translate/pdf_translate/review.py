"""The reviser loop: the two files a second reader needs, and their verdict.

No gate can see a wrong term of art. The first FL-150 to Japanese job exited
verify 0 and qa_check with 0 errors while carrying 世帯主 for "head of
household" — a status a married Japanese reader takes to mean themselves,
where the US filing status is for the unmarried. The page was right and the
string was present; only a second reader found it.

This module is that second reader's plumbing. It writes the pairs file and the
prompt, ingests the review.json that comes back, and grows a per-class termbase
from the accepted terminology findings so the next job of that class is gated
on what this one learned.

It prints nothing, raises nothing and exits nothing, exactly like
qa_check.run_qa and verify.run_verify. It returns a ReviewVerdict; the caller
decides what that means for a console.

Nothing here calls a model. The reviser is a person, or a model the operator
runs — outside this pipeline, in a session of their own.
