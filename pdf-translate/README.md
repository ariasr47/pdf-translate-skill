# pdf-translate

Translate a PDF from any language to any language while keeping the visual
layout pixel-faithful and every fillable form field working.

**Provider-neutral.** Nothing here depends on a particular model, vendor, or
agent framework. The pipeline is plain Python; `SKILL.md` is the workflow an
agent (or a person) follows. It runs the same in any CLI or notebook that can
execute Python and read files.

## Why this exists

The obvious approaches all fail on real forms:

| Approach | What goes wrong |
|---|---|
| White boxes over the old text | Clips rules and borders; reads like a scanlation |
| Redaction annotations | **Deletes form-field widgets** that overlap the redaction |
| Regenerate the document | Never reproduces tables, rules, or field geometry |
| Swap strings inside the text operators | Original fonts have no glyphs for the target script |

This uses **strip-and-retypeset**: delete the text at the content-stream level
(which leaves graphics, images, and field widgets untouched), then re-insert
translated text at the original baselines.

`SKILL.md` carries `metadata.version` in its frontmatter: a monotonic
integer, bumped whenever the scripts or the workflow change. It began as the
number of the last closed program gate (`../dev/goals/PROGRAM.md`, outside
the skill) and kept counting past 17 as the audit roadmap closed. Re-sync any
installed copy when it moves; a copy that shows an older number is running
old scripts. The frontmatter also carries `license: MIT` and a
`compatibility:` line.

## Install

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt      # pymupdf, pikepdf, fonttools
```

`pyftsubset` ships with fonttools. `prepare_font.py` finds it on PATH, in the
interpreter's `Scripts` directory, or as `python -m fontTools.subset`.

## Quickstart

```bash
SK=/path/to/pdf-translate            # this directory

python3 $SK/scripts/strip_text.py      original.pdf stripped.pdf
python3 $SK/scripts/extract_segments.py original.pdf          # -> segments.json, to_translate.json
#   ... author translations.json from to_translate.json ...
python3 $SK/scripts/prepare_font.py    FONT.ttf translations.json font-sub.ttf --instance wght=400
python3 $SK/scripts/retypeset.py       stripped.pdf segments.json translations.json out.pdf
python3 $SK/scripts/verify.py          original.pdf out.pdf --source-words-from segments.json
python3 $SK/scripts/field_fonts.py     out.pdf FULL_FONT.ttf final.pdf     # fillable PDFs only
python3 $SK/scripts/compare.py         original.pdf final.pdf comparison.html \
    --labels "Original|Translated"
```

Hot loop after the first extract (do not re-strip / re-extract / re-subset
the font, and do not run compare until you are delivering):

```bash
python3 $SK/scripts/pipeline.py rebuild --work . original.pdf out.pdf \
    --source-words-from segments.json
python3 $SK/scripts/pipeline.py render original.pdf out.pdf renders/
```

Command-line paths resolve from the caller's directory; `rebuild` does not
change it. Font paths inside `translations.json` resolve beside that file
(absolute paths also work). Older caller-relative font paths still work
when no mapping-relative file exists, with a compatibility note.

From `$SK`:

```bash
python3 tools/fetch_test_fonts.py     # optional; stops the shaping tests skipping
python3 -m unittest tests.test_pipeline tests.test_corpus_verdicts -v
```

drives the shipped stages on tiny constructed PDFs (fillable and non-form).

Then **render every page next to the original and look at them.** The gates
catch structural failures; roughly half of all real defects are visible only
in a render. Budget 2–3 build/inspect/fix rounds — the first build is never
right.

tests/test_pipeline.py          constructed-PDF tests of the shipped stages
tests/test_corpus_verdicts.py   the corpus table
corpus/                         tiny adversarial PDFs + their recorded verdicts
evals/evals.json                optional eval prompts; make_fixtures.py builds their PDFs
```

Development material — the improvement program, session prompts and the
HTML explainers — lives in `../dev/`, outside the skill, so an installed
copy carries only what the workflow needs.

## The guarantee, and its priority order

When requirements conflict: **structure** (fields, links, bookmarks survive and
work) > **layout** (only the text changes) > **natural translation in the
document's register** > file size and everything else.

## Scope

Born-digital PDFs. Scans are out of scope with or without an OCR layer: the
words the reader sees are pixels, and extract/verify refuse such pages; say so
rather than producing a double-printed overlay. Arabic and Indic scripts are shaped through the Story engine and Hebrew
is placed right-to-left; vertical scripts are not handled. Still verify a
rendered sample before committing, and stop and say so if you cannot
(see `references/fonts.md`).
